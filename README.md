# Math Notes
Document containing notes from all the math courses I've taken as well as material I taught myself in order to improve my familiarity with LaTeX and to have a digital version of my notes I can reference.
This is an ongoing project that I've been working on for a number of years and continue to add to as I learn more and expand my knowledge.

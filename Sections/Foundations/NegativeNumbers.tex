\subsection{Negative Numbers}

\subsubsection{Absolute Values}
Negative numbers are less than zero and are exact opposites to their positive counterparts.\\
This essentially means that the number 2 is the same distance from 0 on the number line as the number -2.\\
We denote this imaginary distance as the absolute value of the number. This means that we only consider the positive contributions of that number. It is denoted by $|a|$ and has the property that $|a|=|-a|$.\\
Properties of Absolute Value:
\begin{align*}
    |a|=\sqrt{a^2}\\
    |ab|=|a||b|\\
    \left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}\\
    |a-b|=|b-a|\\
    |a+b|\leq|a|+|b|
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Sign of a Number}
The sign of a number tells us whether it is positive, negative, or zero. It is denoted by $\sgn(a)$.
$$\sgn(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}
1\text{ if }x>0\\
0\text{ if }x=0\\
-1\text{ if }x<0
\end{matrix}\right.$$
Some properties of this are the following:
\begin{align*}
    &\sgn x=\frac{x}{|x|}=\frac{|x|}{x}\\
    &\sgn x=\frac{1}{\sgn x},\,x\neq 0\\
    &\sgn(ab)=\sgn(a)\sgn(b)\\
    &\sgn(ab)=\sgn\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)\\
    &\sgn(x^n)=(\sgn x)^n
\end{align*}
Ex: $\sgn(-4)=-1$

\subsubsection{Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers}
Adding negative numbers is the same thing as subtracting a number and subtracting a negative is the same thing as adding. This can be summed up as follows:\\
-Adding a positive makes it more positive\\
-Adding a negative makes it more negative\\
-Subtracting a positive makes it more negative\\
-Subtracting a negative makes it more negative

\subsubsection{Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers}
The following rules are the same regardless whether you're multiplying or dividing.\\
For $a > 0$ and $b > 0$,\\
$(a)(b)=ab$\\
$(a)(-b)=-ab$\\
$(-a)(b)=-ab$\\
$(-a)(-b)=ab$

\subsubsection{Counting Numbers}
Counting numbers are in the order of $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ and then increase in place value.

\subsubsection{Place Value}
Place value refers to how many digits a number has.\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    ten thousands & thousands & hundreds & tens & ones & tenths & hundredths\\
    10,000 & 1,000 & 100 & 10 & 1 & 0.1 & 0.01
\end{tabular}\\
Standard form is how the number is generally written.\\
Ex: $321$\\
Expanded form is written where the place values are added together.\\
Ex: $300+20+1$\\
Written form is where the number is spelled out.\\
Ex: three-hundred-and-twenty-one

\subsubsection{Rounding}
For digits between 0 and 9 for any specific place value, anything below 5 is rounded down to 0 and anything 5 or more is rounded up to the next highest place value.

\section{Mathematical Proof}
A proof is defined as a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions by a set of axioms.\\
A proposition is a statement that is true/false\\
A predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable. For example, the truth of $x=2$ will depend on the value of $x$\\
An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true. Ex: if $a=b$ and $b=c$ then $a=c$.\\

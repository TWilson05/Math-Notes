\section{Partial Differential Equations}
Partial differential equations are a differential equations involving functions of multiple variables. Some common ones are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Laplace equation
    $$\nabla^2 u=0$$
    \item Heat equation
    $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha^2\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}$$
    \item Wave Equation
    $$\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}$$
\end{itemize}
